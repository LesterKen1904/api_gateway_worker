## Introduction

In today's fast-paced digital world, efficient API management is crucial. The **API Gateway Worker** simplifies this process by acting as a reverse proxy. This allows you to manage multiple services behind a single endpoint, improving performance and security.

## Features

- **Reverse Proxy**: Seamlessly route requests to different services.
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances.
- **SSL Termination**: Handle HTTPS connections securely.
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect your APIs from abuse.
- **Monitoring**: Keep track of API performance and usage.

## Installation

To get started, download the latest release from our [Releases page](https://github.com/LesterKen1904/api_gateway_worker/releases). After downloading, follow these steps:

1. Extract the downloaded file.
2. Navigate to the extracted directory.
3. Execute the worker using the command:

   ```bash
   ./api_gateway_worker
   ```

Ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute the file.

## Usage

Once the worker is running, you can begin routing your API requests. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```bash
curl -X GET http://your-api-gateway-url/api/v1/resource
```

Replace `your-api-gateway-url` with the actual URL of your API gateway. 

## Configuration

The configuration file allows you to customize the behavior of the API Gateway Worker. You can specify:

- **Backend Services**: Define the services that the gateway will route to.
- **Timeouts**: Set timeouts for requests and responses.
- **Logging**: Enable or disable logging for monitoring.

A sample configuration might look like this:

```yaml
services:
  - name: service1
    url: http://localhost:8081
  - name: service2
    url: http://localhost:8082
```

Make sure to adjust the settings according to your environment.
